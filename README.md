## 6.Lesson Learned
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis in Power BI using DAX is a powerful tool for customer segmentation, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies to specific customer groups. By identifying high-value customers, businesses can focus on retention efforts and prevent churn. Targeted marketing campaigns can be designed based on customer behavior, leading to improved engagement and conversion rates. Additionally, RFM analysis aids in resource allocation, product development, and inventory management, ensuring that efforts are directed where they have the most impact. Ultimately, this data-driven approach enhances customer experiences, improves marketing effectiveness, and boosts customer lifetime value (CLV).
